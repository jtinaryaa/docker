#Container : A package consisting of Code and its dependencies.
#Docker : A set of container which is mainly used to manage the conatiners.

#Virtual Machines vs Containers:
-> Virtual Machines are another standalone computer which is installed over a machine and Managing the multiple computers over another computer is very expensive.
-> As virtual machine is another machine and it shares the same CPU Usage and memory/Disc Space so it is very slow in performance.
-> Container is very lightweight and it can be easily installed over any operating systems. We can create an image on any machine and it can be shared over other
   machines. We can also use multiple containers with fast performance.

#Installation
-> Windows: You can install Docker Desktop if all system requirements are meet. If system requirements are not there then we can install Docker Toolbox.
-> MacOS: You can install Docker Desktop if all system requirements are meet. If system requirements are not there then we can install Docker Toolbox.
-> Linux: Linux natively has Docker Engine. So you can install Docker Engine directly on the Linux Operating System.

#Image Creation:
Step 1:
--if you have docker compose file.
    $ docker build .
--this will create a docker image.

Step 2:
--if you application running on port 3000 then you have to open the 3000 port for docker also because your local system doesn't have any connection with docker image.
    $ docker run -p 3000:3000 image_name
--this above command will run the image as container and you can access your application by using 3000 port.
