- it is a simple Node JS application where we have created server.js file where all the code is present.
- Inside the pages folder we have created feedback.html file and when we will access the application by default this feedback form will come.
- We have created two fields in feedback form one is title and second is description.
- Upon submitting the form , one new file is created inside feedback folder with the title name and descripton as the content inside that file.
- Inside this we have created Dockerfile as well to run this application via docker.
